# PTXAS hacking map file 
#
# It specifies the matching rules for ptxas input.
#     Once matched, the output will be replaced by another prepared cubin.
#     If not matched, the original ptxas will be called.
#
# The map file contains a pythonic list of dict, with every dict corresponding to a replacement rule.
# The string will be evaluated as literal python expression (by ast.literal_eval())
# 
#    Supported dict keys (some may be absent, but at least one rule should be provided):
#        replacement (required) : cubin filename to copy from
#        arch : cuda compute capability for cubin, such as sm_50, sm_75
#        ptxname : regex pattern for input ptx filename
#        contents : regex pattern for ptx file contents
#
#    Note:
#        full path of ptx or cubin may be randomly generated for every build.
#        do not rely on the fullpath to match.
#        Usually the last part of filename will be like "*-filename.ptx" for "filename.cu"
